# cpp-cube
A 2D CLI rubix cube game, made as a personal project for an intro to programming for engineers course.
The code is fully commented.
The program presents a randomized, solve-able 2D map of a standard rubix cube. Input can be given in syntax consistent with existing web-apps. A high-score algorithm is provided which retrieves and stores persistent scores with user initials. The scoring algorithm is designed to reward low times and low number of moves, such that either strategy will yield a "good" score.

Completed in spring 2021.
